🥩 # South African Polony Outbreak WGS Analysis
📖 Background
In early 2017, South Africa experienced the largest recorded outbreak of Listeria monocytogenes globally, linked to polony (processed cold meat). By March 2018, over 978 confirmed cases and 183 deaths were reported, with the highest impact on neonates, pregnant women, elderly, and immunocompromised individuals.
This project uses Whole Genome Sequencing (WGS) data from outbreak isolates to:
✅ Confirm the identity of the organism
🧬 Determine the antimicrobial resistance (AMR) profile
☣️ Detect toxin genes that may accelerate fatality
💊 Suggest treatment/antibiotic options
We expect a code report submitted as a markdown — a mix of commands, results, and critical evaluation of methods.

🛠️ ## Workflow Overview

We divided the project into stages:
Stage 0: Dataset download & setup

Stage 1: Quality Control & Read Trimming

Stage 2: Genome Assembly + AMR/Toxin detection
